# GitHub Portfolio 

## DESCRIPTION
Project for MIT xPRO Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Devleopment with MERN. The files include html and css for the home page of my GitHub portfolio. The home page includes a navigation bar with links to an about page and a projects page (which includes three of my projects using GitHub Pages).

## HOW TO RUN

## ROADMAP TO FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
I would like to make the home, about, and projects pages responsive to all devises. I plan to use a media query to do this.
